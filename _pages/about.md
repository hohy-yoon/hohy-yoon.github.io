Welcome! My name is Hohyun Yoon. I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I specialize in International Relations with a focus on leader psychology and signaling. My dissertation investigates how leaders' public expressions of anger during foreign policy crises shape bargaining dynamics, using both observational and experimental data. I am also broadly interested in international security and cooperation, including military alliances.

I received my MA in Political Science from the UW-Madison and my BA in Public Policy from the University of Michigan.
